# Feudal - GDD
## What is Feudal?
Feudal is an online game where players make decisions about their positions with the objective of rising up in the chain of command.
##How does it work?
- Each player starts at the bottom of the tree, with each player having 5 other players below them.
  - The players below him can vote to overthrow him, which will replace him with one of the over-throwers under him, or the players can vote to stay loyal. This process happens once every 24 hours.
  - The player above other players will be able to see what their followers voted.
- The leader receives a certain amount of funds every 20 minutes.
  - The leader can decide how to distribute a certain amount of money. Money can be used to overthrow a leader by hiring mercenaries.
  - Only the top player is given money.
  - Each leader then decides how he wants to split the money among himself, his followers, and his defense.
  - Funds can be used to overthrow a leader. If a leader has more funds in his defensive budget than an attacker, the attack will fail and vice versa.
    - If an attack fails, the player whose attack has failed will lose all money in his defensive fund.
